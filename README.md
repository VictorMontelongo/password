# 03 Password Generator 

## Main funtions

The password generator is designed to provide the user with a randomly generated password consisting of Upper and Lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Currently as the generator functions it should create a password with a minimum of one character and no max characters as far as I could test. The JavaScript consists of an Array build rather than a script that gives the user the ability to customize the randomly generated they seek to create. Attatched is a screeshot of the web browser generator. ![Homepage of the Web Generator](./assets/images/generator.jpg). Additionally attached is the link to the Git Hub page work space. https://github.com/VictorMontelongo/password and the site to the generator itself.
